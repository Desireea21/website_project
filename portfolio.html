<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<p>These are the projects I made in DIG2000 this semseter. I enjoyed this class and learned a lot! </p>


<h5>Photoshop</h5>

<p> This is my photoshop project where I learned to edit images non-destructively. I also learned how to work with masking layers which was very helpful to avoid destructive editing. I wanted to combine images that reflected Luke 12:7 and I think having images with birds, flowers, and the cross helped me to accomplish my vision for this project. </p>

<h5> Stop Motion</h5>
<p> This is my stop motion animation, where I took 194 photos and animated them. I love the game Jenga and thought it would be fun to create the stop motion project building seven layers of the blocks. I took pictures each time I moved the Jenga blocks, and I am pleased with the outcome.</p>

<h5> Video Editing </h5>
<p> This is my video editing project where I learned how to use Premiere Pro video editor. I wanted the video to represent the early days of spring and what a great way to enter spring with some baking. I made the cake, filling, and meringue for the video and used it to assemble the cake. The story for the cake is also based on the stacking of the cake featuring a girl named Emma. I learned a lot from this project, and I look forward to creating and editing more videos in the future. </p>
